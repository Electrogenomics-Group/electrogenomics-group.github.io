# About
The **Electrogenomics group** was established in 2015 by Professors [Munroe](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/munroepatricia.html), [Lambiase](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/878-pier-lambiase), [Tinker](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/tinkerandrew.html) and Dr [Orini](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/m.orini), and initially funded by the Medical Research Council. Our research goal is to unravel the electrical and genetic causes of cardiovascular mortality. Since 2017, we have received funding and support from the BHF UKRI, NIHR and the EU. We are a collaborative group and based at  the William Harvey Research Centre at QMUL,  UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University of Zaragoza, Kings College London and University of Oxford. Our team includes world-leading experts in cardiac electrophysiology, clinician scientists, biomedical engineering, computational medicine, genetics, epigenetics and functional genomics. Our group also comprises PhD students and Post-Doctoral researchers and we are very happy to host research internships and studentships.

We study complex phenotypes of cardiac electrophysiology and response to heart rate dynamics. Building on recent publications by the group, further studies are underway to improve our understanding of the mechanisms linking genetics, functional biology, electrophysiology and cardiovascular disease, and the integration of these biomarkers to optimise risk prediction of cardiac events.
