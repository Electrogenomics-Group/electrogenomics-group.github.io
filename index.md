# About

The **Electrogenomics group** was established in 2015 by Professors Munroe, Lambiase and Tinker. This is a collaboration between the [William Harvey Research Centre](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/) at QMUL and UCL’s [Institute of Cardiovascular Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cardiovascular/ucl-institute-cardiovascular-science). We joined forces in a broad scale attempt to unravel the electrical and genetic causes of cardiovascular mortality. The team includes world-leading experts in cardiac electrophysiology ([Prof. Andy Tinker, QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/tinkerandrew.html) and [Prof. Pier Lambiase UCL](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/878-pier-lambiase)), genetics ([Prof. Patricia Munroe, QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/whri/people/academic-staff/items/munroepatricia.html)) and biomedical engineering ([Dr. Michele Orini, KCL](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/m.orini)), with talented research fellows and PhD students with bioengineering, clinical and genetics training.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We study complex phenotypes of cardiac electrophysiology and response to heart rate dynamics. Building on recent publications by the group, further studies are underway to improve our understanding of the mechanisms linking genetics, functional biology, electrophysiology and cardiovascular disease, and the integration of these biomarkers to optimise risk prediction of cardiac events.
