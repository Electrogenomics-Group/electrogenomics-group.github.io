I trained as a physician at Oxford and then London before undertaking pre and postdoctoral training in the UK (PhD 1990-1993, NHLI, Imperial College) and USA (1994-96, Jan Lab, UCSF) working on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and the molecular properties of potassium channels. I returned to the UK in 1996 and worked for a long time at University College, London as a Wellcome Trust Senior Research fellow in Clinical Science and subsequently Professor of Molecular Medicine. In 2011 I moved to Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry to take up a Chair of Cardiac Electrophysiology. My scientific interests revolve around the molecular properties and regulation of cardiac and smooth muscle cell excitability with a particular focus on cardiac arrhythmia, potassium channels and G-protein signalling. In recognition of this work I was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2006. I have worked on funding committees for the British Heart Foundation, MRC and Wellcome Trust. I was also Head of Clinical Pharmacology at the William Harvey Research Institute (2015-2022).Â
