Christopher Bell gained his PhD in human genomics from Imperial College London, investigating genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and obesity under the supervision of Prof. Philippe Froguel. His post-doctoral training was with Prof. Stephan Beck at the UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, where they pioneered the epigenomic analysis of common human disease. This included publishing some of the very first Epigenome-wide Association Studies (EWAS) as well as ground-breaking integrative analyses of the DNA methylome within common disease-associated loci. He subsequently furthered his epigenomics expertise interrogating the deeply-phenotyped TwinsUK cohort, with Prof. Tim Spector, at King’s College London, and then as an independent group leader at the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit. He is a medical graduate of the University of Otago, New Zealand and, through training with the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, in Sydney, gained his fellowship of genetic pathology. 
He is an expert in human epigenomics and its role in the pathology of common disease, with a specific focus on type 2 diabetes, cardiometabolic disorders, and chronic ageing-related diseases. His research involves large-scale computational, statistical, and functional integration of multi-omic human datasets.
He is an Associate Editor for the journals ‘Epigenetics’ and ‘Clinical Epigenetics’. Also, he is a Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI) Fellow.
