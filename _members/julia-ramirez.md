Julia Ramírez is a ‘Ramón y Cajal’ Senior Research Fellow at the University of Zaragoza, Spain, and holds an honorary lectureship in Cardiovascular Data Science at Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom. Julia received a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Zaragoza in 2017. The main objective of her PhD was to extract information from the electrocardiogram (ECG) to non-invasively quantify cardiovascular risk. She, then, moved to Queen Mary University of London to investigate the genetics of ECG markers and their role in assessing cardiovascular risk. In January 2022, she returned to the University of Zaragoza thanks to the María Zambrano Scheme for Attracting International Talent. Her research has been awarded with two European postdoctoral fellowships (WHRI-ACADEMY COFUND International Fellowship, 2017, and Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship, 2018, by the Marie Curie Actions, H2020, European Commission), six Young Investigator Awards (2013, 2014, 2016, and 2022), two Clinical Needs Translational Awards (2018 and 2019) and three mobility grants (2012, 2015 and 2016).
