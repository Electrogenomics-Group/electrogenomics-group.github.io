Patricia graduated with a B.Sc. in Biochemistry, and M.Sc. in Biotechnology from the University of Galway, Ireland. She then worked at the Wellcome Trust Research Laboratories for six months before commencing a PhD in cardiovascular genetics at St Bartholomew’s Hospital. Patricia was awarded a PhD in Medicine in 1995 and following successful post-doctoral fellowships at University College London (NIH funded), she joined the William Harvey Research Institute as a Lecturer in 1998. In 2007 she was appointed Professor of Molecular Medicine.

Prof Munroe’s lab investigates the molecular basis of cardiac arrythmia’s, hypertension and heart failure. Our research includes genomic studies of cardiovascular risk factors as a route for elucidating disease mechanisms, the development of ‘omic biomarkers and clinical models for improved risk prediction, pharmacogenetics and personalised medicine.

She co-leads several international complex genetic disease consortia. Using meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large-scale candidate gene studies she has discovered over 1000 genetic loci associated with hypertension.  She has also identified hundreds of genetic loci for the electrocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance measures of heart structure and function.  . As a member of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium she co-leads projects leading to the discovery of loci for electrocardiogram markers and gene x environment interactions for cardiovascular risk factors. She is the Director of the Genome Centre at FMD and an Adjunct Professor at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, The University of Toledo, USA.

She was listed as a Highly Cited Researcher by Thomson Reuters in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 (Top 1% in Molecular Biology & Genetics). She was elected as a Fellow of Academy of Medical Sciences in 2021.
