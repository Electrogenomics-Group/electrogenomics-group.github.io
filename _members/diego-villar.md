Dr. Villar graduated in Chemistry and Biochemistry (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain), and obtained a PhD in Molecular Biology with Prof. Luis del Peso, where he studied the signalling and gene expression response to hypoxia in mammalian cells. Also in Madrid, he trained as a postdoctoral scientist with Jose Ramón Naranjo at the National Biotechnology Centre to investigate transcriptional alterations in neurodegeneration. He then joined Dr. Duncan Odom’s laboratory at the Cambridge Institute, where he employed functional genomics approaches to investigate the evolution of transcriptional enhancers across mammals. In 2018 he was awarded a Basic Science Fellowship from the British Heart Foundation to establish his independent laboratory at the Blizard Institute (QMUL).
