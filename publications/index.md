The Electrogenomics Group conducts interdisciplinary research that integrates genomics and electrophysiology to uncover the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying cardiac and vascular function. Our team has produced a series of high-impact scientific publications that significantly advance the understanding of cardiovascular biology. The current activities of the team are centred on studying complex phenotypes of cardiac electrophysiology and response to heart rate dynamics. Building on recent publications by the group,  further studies are underway to improve our understanding of the mechanisms linking genetics, functional biology, electrophysiology and cardiovascular disease, and the integration of these biomarkers to optimise risk prediction of cardiac events.

Explore our latest publications to discover the groundbreaking advancements we are making in the field of electrogenomics.
